  - text: You get it now, right?

  utter_stuck_return_from_games_3:
  - text: "So list it all. Don‚Äôt leave anything out. Even if you think it is inconsequential. That way it helps you analyse both sides better...\n\n
   Done?"

  utter_stuck_return_from_games_4:
  - text: "Okay, now the next step sounds easy but can probably be the toughest bit. It's called - Action, and is the most crucial bit.\n\n
   Sometimes we are so hung up on the decisions far into the future, that we often end up procrastinating the intermediate steps."

  utter_stuck_return_from_games_5:
  - text: For example, if you're confused about which college to apply to, talk to alumni first.
  - text: For instance, if you're confused about where your relationship might end up, talk it out with your partner first.

  utter_stuck_return_from_games_6:
  - text: So take that intermediate step. More often than not, it will help you clear the clutter a little. Sounds good?

  utter_stuck_return_from_games_7:
  - text: "Cool. Finally, your environment often plays a large role in your decision making.\n\n
   Often, being in clustered, busy, noisy areas makes your brain process all these background elements rather than focussing upon the task at hand."

  utter_stuck_return_from_games_8:
  - text: "So go for a walk in nature, or find a quiet place in your house. Go to your secret spot at the top of your building.\n\n
   Find your comfortable place, meditate there and ponder over things. It‚Äôll make them easier to manage.\n\n
   I need your word tho- would you give it a try? It really would help you a lot..."

  utter_stuck_extra_points_1:
  - text: Aside of whatever we discussed so far I have a few points that I want you to keep in mind, wanna see?

  utter_stuck_extra_points_2:
  - text: "Firstly, start meditating regularly.\n\n
   Many researches have shown that meditation is known to give better clarity to your thoughts."

  utter_stuck_extra_points_3:
  - text: "Secondly, ground yourself in the present moment.\n\n
   As I told you earlier, people often think way too much into the future. Don‚Äôt do that. Focus on the 'Now'."

  utter_stuck_extra_points_4:
  - text: "Third and most important - Realise that no decision is a bad decision.\n\n
  When life pushes you to decide, it is pushing you towards valuable life lessons.\n\n
  Every experience your decision makes you live, is an experience in growth. You will look back and thank the decision later. So never be afraid to decide."
